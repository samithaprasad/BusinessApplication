# BusinessApplication
Desktop Application for a Small Business.

<h3> This is a desktop application that can use by a small business. It includes the owner account and seller accounts. It has stock management, and transaction management, and generates final reports also. These include functions such as View stock, view re-order level items, Add stock, petty cash Expenses, Debtors, and Services Income. The focus also here was on validation and authentication. <br/> ðŸ‘‡<br/> I used C#, Visual Studio, Crystal Reports, and MySQL for this. </h3>
